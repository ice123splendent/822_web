            (CNN) — It's 50 years since man first stepped on the moon, 
            and we're still harboring dreams of escaping life on Earth for the mysteries of space. <br><br>

            If a career as an astronaut isn't for you
            , perhaps the promise of a sojourn in a space hotel might be appealing. <br><br>

            Californian company The <span style = "color: black"><a href = "https://gatewayspaceport.com"></span>Gateway Foundation</a> has released plans for the Von Braun Station
            , a cruise ship-style hotel floating among the stars. <br><br>

            The aim is to get the hotel off the ground by 2025 and make it fully operational for travel by 2027. <br><br>
            
            The Von Braun station is just one such space-based tourism option in development. 
            Also planning to propel people into space are Virgin Galactic
            , Elon Musk's SpaceX company and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin aerospace company, 
            not to mention the International Space Station
             -- which recently announced the possibility of commercial collaborations. <br><br>
            
            The Von Braun Station is also not the only space hotel design in the works. 
            Earlier in 2019, US-based space tech startup Orion Span released plans for a luxury space hotel called Aurora Station
            , which it hopes to launch in 2022.

            According to digitally rendered video and images released by the Gateway Foundation
            , the station resembles a rotating wheel, comprised of 24 modules, orbiting the Earth. <br><br>

            But how would the physics of the hotel work?
            Tim Alatorre, senior design architect at the Gateway Foundation
            , says the rotating wheel would create a simulated gravity. <br><br>

            "The station rotates, pushing the contents of the station out to the perimeter of the station
            , much in the way that you can spin a bucket of water
             -- the water pushes out into the bucket and stays in place," he tells CNN Travel. <br><br>

            Near the center of the station there's no artificial gravity, Alatorre says
            , but as you move down the outside of the station, the feeling of gravity increases.
